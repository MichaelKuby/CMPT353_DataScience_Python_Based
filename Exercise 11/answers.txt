Briefly describe what would have happened if you     hadn't used .cache() anywhere. (No need to time it, unless you really want to.)        First I cached the dataframe comments, as it was used first to create the averages, and then join upon to create     the full dataframe with average scores joined.        Second, I cached joined itself, as it was used to create max_rel_scores, and was also joined upon itself to create    so that we could retreive the author of the highest relative rating.    2.  How did marking DataFrames for broadcast affect the running time of the “best author” program above?    It seems as though others had trouble gettinh broadcasting to have an effect (based on the discussion forum).    My experience was that without it, times were slowed down significantly. Run time with broadcasting was 48 seconds.    Run time without broadcasting was 2 minutes and 28 seconds.
